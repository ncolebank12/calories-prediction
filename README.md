# Framing the Problem

In this analysis, I will be examining how the calories of recipes can be best predicted. Since calories are a continuous variable, this will be a regression prediction problem. 

The response variable is the first element in the 'nutrition' column, as this value corresponds to the calories for the recipe. I am interested to see what factors in this dataset influence the number of calories besides the macronutrient information (since this data can be used to directly calculate the number of calories in a recipe). 

The metric I will be using to evaluate the quality of the model is the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). This will be best in comparing the baseline model to the final model as it will show the average deviation between the actual and predicted calories. Since it is difficult to evaluate a regression model's quality solely on the RMSE, I will also calculate the R^2 to see how much the predictor variables explain variation in the predicted values.
